Inviting customers to subscribe
------------------------------------------------
Food delivery service's orders are stored into table t_orders:

order_id - unique order's id
customer_id - id of customer
order_dt  - date and time of the order
order_amount - price of the order

Need to make a query which will find all customers who have done at least 3 orders with no more than 31 days gap between orders for sending them a special subscription offer.
